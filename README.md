Linear Regression Project Proposal

Fantasy Premier League Point Prediction

I am going to develop a Linear regression model to predict the points a player will obtain in a given game week, given data from previous weeks and previous seasons/years in the Fantasy Premier league (FPL).

FPL is an online fantasy game for the English Premier League, played by approximately 8 million people across the world. The goal is to score as many points as possible from a select total of 15 players (11 starters + 4 substitutions) from the given pool of 687 players.  
 
My hypothesis is that given the available player data every week, I can predict points scored for the coming week with enough accuracy, that I would personally use my model as a tool for player selection.
